However, the approach that I will take here is the one put forward by Holston, Lauback and Williams (2017) which is more an equilibrium concept that uses a time series approach.\n\nIt's imporant to note that this $r_{t}^{*}$ variable is attached to slow-moving forces that hardly change except when there is a big disruption in the economy. As an example, these are the forces that can affect the natural interest rate:\n\n\n* Changes in labor productivity that affect the amount of labor supplied or the return on investment\n* Household's desire to save or to realocate current consumption from the future\n* Public debt or government consumption that affect the use of aggregate savings in the economy\n* Capital flows, that is, the amount of financial resources coming from the rest of the world\n* The risk premia that the savers would like to received in return for their borrowed assets\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog_Taylor_Rule_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Monetary Policy Rules\n\n---\n\nPolicy Rules              | Formula\n--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTaylor Rule               | $R_t^T = r_t^{*} + \\pi_t + 0.5(\\pi_t - \\pi^{*}) + 0.5(y_t - y_t^P)$\nInertial rule             | $R_t^I = 0.85R_{t-1} + 0.15[r_t^{*} + \\pi_t + 0.5(\\pi_t - \\pi^{*}) + (y_t - y_t^P)]$\nBalanced-approach rule    | $R_t^{BA} = r_t^{*} + \\pi_t + 0.5(\\pi_t - \\pi^{*}) + (y_t - y_t^P)$\nELB-adjusted rule         | $R_t^{ELB} = max\\{ R_{t-1}^{BA} - Z_t, 0 \\}$\nFirst-difference rule     | $R_t^{FD} = R_{t-1} + 0.1(\\pi_t - \\pi^*) + 0.1(y_t - y_{t-4})$\n\n\n### Taylor Rule (inertial)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Taylor Rule originally proposed by John B. Taylor is a prescription for the level of federal funds rate such that the monetary policy supports price stability and sustain GDP growth. The general formulation of the rule is the following:\n\n\n$R^{T}_{t} = \\rho R^{T}_{t-1} + (1 - \\rho) [ r^{*} + \\bar{\\pi}_t + \\beta ( \\pi_{t}  - \\bar{\\pi}_t ) + \\gamma x_{t} ],$\n\nwhere $R^{T}_{t}$ is the federal funds prescribed rate in quarter t, $r_t^{*}$ is the natural interest rate estimated above, $\\pi_{t}$ is the four-quarter inflation rate, $\\bar{\\pi}_t$ is the central bank's objective for inflation, and $x_{t}$ measures the percentage difference of GDP from its potential level or output gap. The $\\rho$ parameter is a measure of persistence that smooths the series to make gradual adjustments in the policy rate, $\\beta$ is the weight on the inflation gap and $\\gamma$ the weight on the output gap. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog_Taylor_Rule_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors. 2018.
